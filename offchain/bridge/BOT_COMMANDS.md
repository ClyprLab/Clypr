    "webhookUrl": "https://your-domain.com/telegram/webhook"
  }
}
```

## User Flow

### Typical Verification Process:

1. **User requests verification** in the Clypr app
2. **App generates a verification token** and sends it to the bridge
3. **User receives the token** from the app
4. **User sends token to bot** using any of the methods above
5. **Bot validates the token** and confirms verification
6. **User receives success message** and can return to the app

### Example Conversation:

```
User: /start
Agent: üëã Welcome! I'm your Clypr Agent
      I'm here to help you verify your identity and manage your Clypr account.
      To get started:
      1. Request verification in your Clypr app
      2. Copy the verification token from the app
      3. Paste it here or use /verify <token>
      Need help? Just type /help and I'll show you what I can do!

User: abc123def456
Agent: ‚úÖ Perfect! You're all set!
      Your identity has been successfully verified with Clypr.
      You can now return to your Clypr app and continue using all the features.
      Is there anything else I can help you with? üöÄ
```

## Frontend Integration

### Channel Creation Flow:

1. **User selects Telegram** as channel type in the frontend
2. **Frontend calls** `requestTelegramVerification(true)` to create placeholder channel
3. **Backend generates token** and returns it with channel ID
4. **Frontend opens Telegram** with the verification token
5. **User completes verification** in Telegram chat
6. **Frontend polls for status** and updates when verification is complete

### Configuration:

The frontend uses configurable bot settings from `clypr-config.json`:

```typescript
import { getTelegramConfig, getTelegramBotStartUrl } from '../utils/config';

const telegramConfig = getTelegramConfig();
const botStartUrl = getTelegramBotStartUrl(token);
```

## Error Messages

### Token Not Found
```
I don't see a verification token in your message. Here's how you can share it with me:

‚Ä¢ Just paste the token directly (I'll recognize it!)
‚Ä¢ Use /verify <token>
‚Ä¢ Use /start <token>

Make sure you're using the complete token from your Clypr app. If you need help, just type /help!
```

### Token Unknown or Expired
```
I don't recognize that verification token - it might be expired or invalid. Please request a new verification in your Clypr app and try again.

You can share the new token with me by:
‚Ä¢ Pasting it directly
‚Ä¢ Using /verify <token>
‚Ä¢ Using /start <token>
```

### Token Expired
```
That verification token has expired. Please request a new verification from your Clypr app.

You can share the new token with me by:
‚Ä¢ Pasting it directly
‚Ä¢ Using /verify <token>
‚Ä¢ Using /start <token>
```

## Testing

To test the bot commands, you can use the test script:

```bash
# Add your chat ID to .env file
echo "TEST_CHAT_ID=your_chat_id" >> .env

# Run tests
npm run test-agent commands
```

## Technical Details

- **Token Format**: Tokens are typically alphanumeric strings
- **Token Expiry**: Tokens expire after 15 minutes by default
- **Duplicate Prevention**: The bot prevents processing the same message multiple times
- **Webhook Response**: Always returns 200 OK to prevent Telegram retries
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with helpful user messages
- **Configuration**: Bot settings are configurable through frontend config
