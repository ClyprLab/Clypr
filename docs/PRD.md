# Clypr Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Overview

Clypr is a decentralized communication privacy relay built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) that empowers users to control how they receive communications from Web3 applications. By providing each user with their own privacy agent (canister), Clypr creates a programmable barrier between dApps and users' real-world communication channels, ensuring privacy while maintaining effective communication.

## Problem Statement

Web3 users currently face several challenges with application communications:

1. **Privacy Concerns**: dApps often require direct access to email or phone numbers
2. **Notification Overload**: Users receive too many notifications without filtering options
3. **Limited Control**: Insufficient granularity in controlling which messages reach users
4. **Contact Information Exposure**: Personal contact details are shared with multiple applications
5. **Inconsistent Delivery**: Notifications may arrive through different channels with no unified management

## Product Vision

Clypr aims to be the definitive privacy layer for Web3 communications, giving users complete control over their notification experience while providing dApps with a standardized messaging interface.

## Target Users

1. **Web3 Users**: People using decentralized applications who want privacy and control
2. **dApp Developers**: Teams building applications that need to communicate with users
3. **Privacy-Focused Organizations**: Companies prioritizing user privacy and data protection

- **Message Formatting**: Appropriate formatting for each channel
- **Delivery Status**: Track and report message delivery status
- **Retry Logic**: Handle failed delivery attempts

#### Technical Requirements

- **Authentication**: Secure communication with user canisters
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of external APIs
- **Reliability**: 99.9% delivery success rate for approved messages
- **Latency**: Deliver messages within 5 seconds of approval

### 5. Admin Frontend

#### Functional Requirements

- **Dashboard**: Overview of message activity and rule effectiveness
- **Rule Editor**: Intuitive interface for creating and managing rules
- **Message Browser**: View, search, and filter message history
- **Settings Management**: Configure privacy preferences and contact details

#### Technical Requirements

- **Compatibility**: Support modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

## User Journeys

### 1. New User Onboarding

1. User visits Clypr and authenticates with Internet Identity
2. User creates a new privacy agent (canister)
3. User adds contact information (email/phone)
4. User sets up initial privacy rules from templates
5. User receives instructions for updating dApp permissions

### 2. dApp Message Sending

1. dApp sends message to user's canister using standard interface
2. User's canister evaluates message against privacy rules
3. If approved, message is forwarded to webhook service
4. Webhook delivers message to appropriate channel
5. Delivery status is recorded

### 3. Rule Management

1. User logs into Clypr admin interface
2. User reviews message history and identifies unwanted messages
3. User creates new rule to filter similar messages
4. User tests rule against sample messages
5. User activates rule and monitors effectiveness

## Success Metrics

1. **User Adoption**: Number of active privacy agents
2. **Message Volume**: Number of messages processed
3. **Rule Effectiveness**: Percentage of messages correctly filtered
4. **User Satisfaction**: Feedback scores and retention rate
5. **dApp Integration**: Number of applications using the standard interface

## Future Considerations

1. **Additional Channels**: Push notifications, Telegram, Discord, etc.
2. **Machine Learning**: Automated rule suggestions based on user behavior
3. **Delegated Management**: Allow trusted third parties to manage rules
4. **Integration Ecosystem**: Plugins for popular dApps and platforms
5. **Mobile App**: Dedicated mobile application for rule management

## Constraints and Limitations

1. **ICP Cycles**: Message processing consumes cycles, requiring economic model
2. **External Services**: Reliance on Twilio/SendGrid for final delivery
3. **Rule Complexity**: Balance between flexibility and usability
4. **Privacy Trade-offs**: Some metadata required for proper filtering

## Release Planning

### Phase 1: MVP (Month 1-2)
- Basic user canister with simple rule engine
- Email-only webhook bridge
- Minimal admin interface

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (Month 3-4)
