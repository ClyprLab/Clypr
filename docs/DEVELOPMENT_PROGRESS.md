# Clypr Development Progress Tracker

This document tracks the development progress, current status, and future roadmap for the Clypr project.

**Last Updated:** Hackathon Progress

## Overview

Clypr is a decentralized communication privacy relay built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) that empowers users to control how they receive communications from Web3 applications. By providing each user with their own privacy agent (canister), Clypr creates a programmable barrier between dApps and users' real-world communication channels, ensuring privacy while maintaining effective communication.

## Technical Debt & Known Issues

1. **TypeScript Configuration**
   - Missing type declarations need to be addressed
   - JSX runtime issues need resolution
   - ~~Implicit `any` types in styled-components~~ (Fixed July 26, 2025)

2. **Development Environment**
   - Need to standardize local development setup
   - Add comprehensive README for developer onboarding
   - Set up consistent linting and formatting rules

3. **Testing**
   - No automated tests currently in place
   - Need unit tests for UI components
   - Need integration tests for canister interaction

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate Tasks (Next 2 Weeks)
1. Complete the Text component to properly handle the `as` prop
2. Create rule editor interface
3. Implement dark mode toggle
4. Begin User Privacy Canister implementation
5. Set up testing framework

### Short-term Tasks (Next Month)
1. Complete basic Rule Engine implementation
2. Connect frontend to backend canisters
3. Implement message history visualization
4. Create channel configuration interface
5. Add unit tests for core functionality

### Medium-term Tasks (Next 3 Months)
1. Build webhook bridge service
2. Implement email and SMS delivery integration
3. Create analytics dashboard for message processing
4. Add advanced rule conditions
5. Implement notification system for rule triggers

### Long-term Goals
1. Add multi-user organization features
2. Create integrations with popular dApps
3. Develop SDK for easy developer integration
4. Build marketplace for rule templates

## Resource Allocation

| Component | Team Members | Time Allocation |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Frontend | Frontend Team | 50% of resources |
| Backend | Backend Team | 30% of resources |
| Webhook Service | DevOps Team | 10% of resources |
| Testing & QA | QA Team | 10% of resources |

## Dependencies

- Internet Computer SDK
- React & TypeScript ecosystem
- Node.js for webhook service
- SendGrid & Twilio APIs
- CI/CD pipeline tools

## Open Questions & Decisions

1. **Scalability Strategy**
   - How to handle high message volume efficiently?
   - What are the cycle costs for different operations?

2. **Security Considerations**
   - How to ensure message security end-to-end?
   - What encryption standards to implement?

3. **User Experience**
   - How to make rule creation intuitive for non-technical users?
   - What templates to provide for common use cases?

## Weekly Progress Updates

### Week of July 26, 2025
- Created initial frontend structure
- Set up authentication with Internet Identity
- Resolved Internet Computer SDK dependencies and polyfills
- Developed core UI components
- Created landing page with compelling copy
- Added routing structure with protected routes

## Conclusion

The Clypr project is making good progress on the frontend development phase. The next critical step is to begin the backend canister implementation while continuing to refine the frontend components and UI. Regular updates to this document will help track progress and ensure all team members are aligned on priorities.
