# Backend Implementation Proposal

**Status:** Planning Phase

## Overview

This document outlines the technical implementation plan for the Clypr backend services, focusing on the core canister infrastructure, rule engine, AI spam detection system, and webhook bridge service.

## 1. User Privacy Canister

### Technology Stack
- **Primary Language:** Motoko
- **Alternative Option:** Rust for performance-critical components
- **Storage:** Orthogonal persistence
- **Authentication:** Internet Identity integration

### Implementation Strategy

#### 1.1 Core Canister Structure
```motoko
actor UserPrivacyCanister {
  // User profile and preferences
  private var owner : Principal;
  private var preferences : UserPreferences;
  
  // Message storage
  private stable var messages : [Message];
  private var messageIndex : HashMap<MessageId, Message>;
  
  // Rule storage
  private stable var rules : [Rule];
  private var activeRules : HashMap<RuleId, Rule>;
  
  // Channel configuration
  private stable var channels : [Channel];
  
  // Message processing
  public shared(msg) func receiveMessage(message : NewMessage) : async MessageReceipt {
    // Validate sender
    // Store message
    // Apply rules
    // Trigger delivery if applicable
    // Return receipt
  };
  
  // Rule management
  public shared(msg) func addRule(rule : NewRule) : async RuleId {
    // Validate caller is owner
    // Validate rule structure
    // Add to rules collection
    // Return rule ID
  };
  
  // Additional methods for rule/message/channel management
  // ...
}
```

#### 1.2 Data Models

**Message Model:**
```motoko
type Message = {
  id : MessageId;
  sender : Principal;
  timestamp : Time.Time;
  subject : Text;
  content : Text;
  metadata : Metadata;
  status : MessageStatus;
  classification : ?Classification;
};
```

**Rule Model:**
```motoko
type Rule = {
  id : RuleId;
  name : Text;
  description : ?Text;
  conditions : [Condition];
  actions : [Action];
  isActive : Bool;
  createdAt : Time.Time;
  updatedAt : ?Time.Time;
};
```

#### 1.3 Development Phases

1. **Basic Infrastructure (Weeks 1-2)**
   - Canister initialization and user identity binding
   - Basic message storage and retrieval
   - Simple rule structure implementation

2. **Core Functionality (Weeks 3-4)**
   - Rule evaluation engine
   - Message processing pipeline
   - Simple webhook integration

3. **Enhanced Features (Weeks 5-6)**
   - Advanced rule conditions
   - Multiple channel support
   - Message history and querying

## 2. Rule Engine

### Technology Stack
- **Implementation:** Native Motoko/Rust within user canister
- **Optimization:** Strategic pattern matching for efficient rule evaluation

### Implementation Strategy

#### 2.1 Rule Evaluation Flow
1. Message received by canister
2. Extract message attributes for evaluation
3. Fetch applicable rules (active only)
4. Evaluate each rule's conditions against message
5. For matching rules, collect required actions
6. De-duplicate and prioritize actions
7. Execute actions in priority order

#### 2.2 Condition Types
- Sender-based conditions
- Content pattern matching
- Temporal conditions
- Metadata conditions
- AI classification-based conditions

#### 2.3 Action Types
- Deliver to channel(s)
- Archive message
- Discard message
- Transform message
- Set message priority

#### 2.4 Optimization Strategy
- Index rules by common condition types
- Short-circuit evaluation for quick filtering
- Batch similar condition evaluations
- Cache frequently used pattern matches

## 3. AI Spam Detection System

### Technology Stack
- **On-Chain Components:** TensorFlow Lite models
- **External Services:** Optional integration with specialized AI services
- **Model Training:** Offline training pipeline with deployment system

### Implementation Strategy

#### 3.1 On-Chain Components
- Feature extraction from message metadata
- Lightweight model for basic classification
- Sender reputation tracking
- Integration with rule engine

#### 3.2 Optional External AI Service
- RESTful API for enhanced classification
- Secure, anonymized message processing
- Model versioning and updates
- Performance metrics and monitoring

#### 3.3 Classification Pipeline
1. Extract features from incoming message
2. Perform lightweight classification on-chain
3. If confidence is low and user has opted in:
   a. Send anonymized features to external service
   b. Receive enhanced classification
4. Store classification with message
5. Make classification available to rule engine

#### 3.4 Implementation Phases
1. **Basic Implementation (Weeks 1-2)**
   - Feature extraction framework
   - Simple rule-based classifiers
   - Classification storage

2. **Enhanced Models (Weeks 3-4)**
   - Deploy optimized TensorFlow Lite models
   - Implement sender reputation system
   - Add user feedback collection

3. **Advanced Features (Weeks 5-6)**
   - External AI service integration
   - Model update mechanism
   - Performance monitoring

## 4. Webhook Bridge Service

### Technology Stack
- **Implementation:** Node.js/TypeScript
- **Security:** HTTPS with client certificates
- **Scalability:** Kubernetes deployment
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus/Grafana

### Implementation Strategy

#### 4.1 Architecture
- Separate service from ICP canisters
- Secure API for canister communication
- Rate limiting and abuse protection
- Channel provider integrations

#### 4.2 Channel Support
1. **Email (SendGrid)**
   - Template-based formatting
   - Delivery tracking
   - Bounce handling

2. **SMS (Twilio)**
   - Message formatting
   - Delivery confirmation
   - Two-way communication support

3. **Additional Channels**
   - Push notifications
   - Messaging platforms (Telegram, Discord)
   - Custom webhook endpoints

#### 4.3 Security Considerations
- Mutual TLS authentication
- Rate limiting per user canister
- Input validation and sanitization
- Sensitive data handling (no storage)
- Regular security audits
