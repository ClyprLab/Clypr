# Clypr Backend Architecture

**Status:** Planning Phase

## Overview

The Clypr backend is built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), leveraging its decentralized architecture to provide a privacy-first communication relay system. Each user is provisioned with their own privacy agent (canister) that serves as a programmable intermediary between applications and the user's real-world communication channels.

## Core Components

### 1. User Privacy Canister

The User Privacy Canister is the central component of the Clypr backend architecture. Each user has their own canister instance which:

- Stores the user's communication preferences and privacy rules
- Processes incoming messages from applications
- Applies rules and filtering logic to determine message routing
- Interfaces with the webhook bridge for external communications
- Maintains an encrypted message history

**Technical Specifications:**
- Written in Motoko/Rust
- Deployed on the Internet Computer
- Uses Orthogonal Persistence for data storage
- Implements Principal-based authentication

### 2. Rule Engine

The Rule Engine is responsible for evaluating incoming messages against user-defined privacy rules.

**Features:**
- Boolean logic for rule conditions
- Pattern matching for message content
- Sender reputation evaluation
- Time-based rules (e.g., quiet hours)
- Priority-based message routing
- Action execution based on rule matches

**Rule Structure:**
```json
{
  "ruleId": "unique-identifier",
  "name": "User-friendly name",
  "conditions": [
    { "type": "sender", "operator": "equals", "value": "app.example" },
    { "type": "content", "operator": "contains", "value": "urgent" }
  ],
  "actions": [
    { "type": "route", "channel": "sms" },
    { "type": "priority", "level": "high" }
  ],
  "active": true
}
```

### 3. AI-Powered Spam Detection

A key feature of the Clypr backend is its AI-powered spam detection system, which enhances the rule engine with intelligent filtering capabilities.

**Capabilities:**
- Message content classification (spam, marketing, transaction, etc.)
- Sender reputation scoring
- Pattern recognition for suspicious content
- Adaptive learning based on user feedback
- Language and intent analysis

**Implementation Options:**
1. **On-Chain AI:**
   - Lightweight ML models deployed directly on the canister
   - Limited but privacy-preserving classification
   
2. **External AI Service:**
   - Integration with specialized AI services
   - Higher accuracy but requires privacy considerations
   - Anonymized content analysis

3. **Hybrid Approach:**
   - Basic filtering on-chain
   - Complex analysis through secure external services
   - User control over AI feature usage

### 4. Webhook Bridge Service

The Webhook Bridge Service enables communication between the user's canister and external communication channels.

**Features:**
- Secure API for canister-to-external communication
- Support for email delivery (SendGrid integration)
- Support for SMS delivery (Twilio integration)
- Support for push notifications
- Encrypted data transmission
- Rate limiting and abuse protection

## Data Flow

1. **Message Reception:**
   - Application sends message to user's privacy canister
   - Message is validated and stored securely

2. **Rule Evaluation:**
   - Message is analyzed by the rule engine
   - AI spam detection evaluates message content
   - Matching rules are identified

3. **Action Execution:**
   - Determined actions are executed
   - Messages are routed to appropriate channels
   - User notification preferences are respected

4. **External Delivery:**
   - If external delivery is required, the webhook bridge is used
   - Secure, encrypted transmission to external providers

## Security Considerations

- All user data is stored in their personal canister
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive information
- Principle of least privilege for canister access
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Regular security audits and updates

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- User Privacy Canister initial implementation
- Basic rule engine functionality
- Simple webhook bridge integration

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
- AI spam detection integration
- Advanced rule conditions
- Multiple channel support
- Message history and analytics

### Phase 3: Ecosystem Expansion
- Developer SDK for application integration
- Additional communication channels
- Enhanced AI capabilities
- Community rule templates

## Technical Stack

- **Canister Development:** Motoko/Rust
- **Webhook Bridge:** Node.js/TypeScript
- **AI Components:** TensorFlow.js or similar
- **External Integrations:** SendGrid, Twilio, etc.
- **Testing:** Unit tests, integration tests, canister tests

## Open Questions & Considerations

- Scalability of individual user canisters
- Cost optimization for cycles consumption
- Privacy preservation in AI analysis
- Compliance with regional data protection regulations
- Backup and recovery mechanisms
