# Clypr Development Progress Report (Aug 2025)

## Completed Features

### Authentication & Infrastructure
- ✅ Internet Identity integration (local + mainnet)
- ✅ Local end-to-end deploy script (`deploy-ic.sh`)

### Backend
- ✅ Persistent actor with stable storage
- ✅ Alias system: registerUsername/getMyUsername/resolveUsername
- ✅ Public endpoints: notifyAlias, notifyPrincipal, and resolveUsername (processMessage deprecated)
- ✅ Rules: CRUD with dappPrincipal, priority, active flag
- ✅ Channels: CRUD with types and config
- ✅ Message processing: default allow, block support, receipts
- ✅ Stats endpoint

### Frontend
- ✅ Layout, Dashboard, Rules, Channels, Messages, Settings
- ✅ Service layer aligned to Candid (opt as []|[], nat as BigInt)
- ✅ Uses generated backend.did.js
- ✅ Local build passes; mainnet backend reinstalled

## Current Status
- RuleEngine evaluates conditions, priority sort, dApp filter
- MessageProcessor applies first matching rule actions (block/deliver)

## Known Issues / Gaps
- Route/transform/prioritize actions not yet executed end-to-end
- No webhook outcalls yet (delivery to Email/SMS not implemented)
- Public endpoints lack rate limiting/allowlists
- Billing/top-ups not implemented

## Next Steps
- Implement routing and content transform in MessageProcessor
- Add webhook bridge via HTTPS outcalls
- Add Settings UI: alias claim/availability check
- Document notifyAlias for integrators; optional JS SDK
- Add quotas/billing and a Billing page
