## üéØ Project Overview

**Clypr** is a revolutionary programmable privacy gateway for Web3 messaging, built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). It empowers users to take complete control over how decentralized applications (dApps) communicate with them through customizable privacy rules and intelligent filtering.

### üåü The Problem We Solve

In the current Web3 ecosystem, users lack control over their communication privacy. dApps often require direct access to personal contact information (email, phone), leading to:
- **Privacy violations** - Personal data exposed to multiple dApps
- **Spam overload** - Unwanted messages from various sources
- **No filtering control** - Users can't customize what messages they receive
- **Fragmented communication** - Messages scattered across different platforms

### üí° Our Solution

Clypr creates a **personal privacy agent** for each user - a dedicated canister that acts as an intelligent gateway between dApps and real-world communication channels. Instead of dApps sending messages directly to users, they send messages to the user's privacy canister, which:

1. **Evaluates** messages against user-defined privacy rules
2. **Filters** unwanted content using AI-powered spam detection
3. **Routes** approved messages to preferred channels (email, SMS, webhooks)
4. **Preserves** user privacy by never exposing real contact information

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Production Application

The Clypr application is fully deployed on the Internet Computer. You can access it directly at:

```
https://5nif7-uaaaa-aaaag-aufha-cai.icp0.io/
```

No installation needed! Just visit the URL and start using Clypr.

### For Developers

If you want to contribute or run the application locally, follow these steps:

#### Prerequisites

- **DFINITY Canister SDK (dfx)** - [Quick Install](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install/):
  ```bash
  sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"
  ```

#### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abdushakurob/clypr.git
cd clypr
```

2. **Start the local Internet Computer replica**
```bash
dfx start --background
```

3. **Deploy the application locally**
```bash
./deploy-ic.sh
```

4. **Access the application**
- Local deployment will be available at: `http://localhost:4943`
- Your canister ID will be shown in the terminal after deployment

### Deployment Process

#### Local Testing
After making changes, test them locally:
```bash
./deploy-ic.sh
```

#### Production Deployment
Deployment to Internet Computer mainnet requires proper credentials:
```bash
# Deploy to mainnet (requires deployment credentials)
./deploy-ic-mainnet.sh
```

Note: Production deployment is handled by project maintainers. Contributors should focus on local development and testing.
