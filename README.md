# Clypr - Decentralized Communication Privacy Relay

![Clypr Logo](assets/clypr-logo.png)

## The Privacy Layer for Web3 Communications

Clypr is a programmable privacy gateway for Web3 messaging built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). It enables users to control how dApps communicate with them through customizable privacy rules.

## üîê Overview

In the Web3 ecosystem, users need greater control over how applications communicate with them. Clypr creates a privacy layer between decentralized applications and users' real-world communication channels. Instead of dApps sending messages directly to a user's email or phone, they send messages to the user's personal canister (privacy agent), which evaluates the messages against user-defined rules before forwarding approved messages via secure webhooks to the user's preferred channels.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Personal Privacy Agent**: Each user gets a dedicated canister that acts as their privacy gateway
- **Programmable Rules**: Define granular conditions for which messages get forwarded
- **Channel Management**: Control which messages go to which communication channels
- **AI-Powered Spam Detection**: Intelligent filtering using machine learning
- **dApp Integration**: Standard messaging protocol for Web3 applications
- **Privacy Preservation**: dApps never see users' actual contact information
- **Message Transformations**: Modify messages before delivery based on custom rules

## üõ† Architecture

Clypr consists of four main components:

1. **dApp Message Interface**: Standardized protocol for sending messages to user canisters
2. **User Privacy Canister**: Personal agent that evaluates messages against rules
3. **AI Spam Detection System**: Machine learning-based filtering for unwanted communications
4. **Webhook Bridge Service**: Secure relay that delivers approved messages to external channels
5. **Admin Frontend**: User interface for managing privacy rules and preferences
